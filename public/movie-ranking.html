<h2>My top three movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Pursuit of Happyness</h3>
    <p>The main focus of the movie was f you believe you can do something and have a goal, stick to it and follow it through.</p>

<h3>Dil Dhadakne Do</h3>
    <p>Great advises not only for families and relationships but for a lot of things that we face in daily life and how we are.</p>

<h3>Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani</h3>
    <p>It's a movie, which tells us how to live our life in our own ways by putting our dreams in mind so that we live our dreams, we never get bore from our life. We love our life. We chase our dreams by making different plans. We can enjoy our life by living in present not by thinking about Past.</p>
